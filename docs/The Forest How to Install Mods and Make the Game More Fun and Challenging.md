## What You Need to Install Mods for The Forest
 
Before you start installing mods for The Forest, you need to make sure you have the following things:
 
- The Forest game installed on your PC. You can buy it from [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/242760/The_Forest/) or other platforms.
- A mod manager tool that can help you download, install, and manage your mods. We recommend using [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21), which is a free and easy-to-use mod manager that supports many games, including The Forest.
- A Nexus Mods account that can allow you to access and download mods from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/theforest), which is one of the largest and most popular modding websites for The Forest and other games.
- A backup of your game files and save files in case something goes wrong or you want to revert to the vanilla version of the game. You can find your game files in your Steam library folder (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\TheForest) and your save files in your AppData folder (usually C:\Users\YourName\AppData\LocalLow\SKS\TheForest).
